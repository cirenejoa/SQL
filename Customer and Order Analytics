-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were made in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customers acct numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent by those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold

SELECT Product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
